            <p class="verse-1">Verse 1:<br>
            Well you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
            Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go</p>

            <p class="chorus">Chorus:<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</p>

            <p class="verse-2">Verse 2:<br>
            Staring at the bottom of your glass<br>
            Hoping one day you'll make a dream last<br>
            But dreams come slow and they go so fast<br>
            You see her when you close your eyes<br>
            Maybe one day you'll understand why<br>
            Everything you touch surely dies</p>

            <p class="bridge">Bridge:<br>
            But you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go</p>

            <p class="chorus">Chorus:<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</p>

            <p class="verse-3">Outro:<br>
            And you let her go</p>

            <p>End.</p>
